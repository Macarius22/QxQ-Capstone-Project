## Usage

The project consists of the following main components:

- `QKD`: Implements the Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol to generate secure encryption keys.
- `encrypt_message`: Provides functions for encrypting messages using classical encryption algorithms.
- `decrypt_message`: Provides functions for decrypting messages using classical encryption algorithms.

To use the project:

1. Run the `QKD` script to generate a secure encryption key using QKD.
2. Use the generated key to encrypt a message using the `encrypt_message` script.
3. Use the same key to decrypt the encrypted message using the `dencrypt_message` script.


## Features

- Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) for secure key generation.
- Encryption of messages using classical encryption algorithms.
- Decryption of encrypted messages using classical encryption algorithms.
